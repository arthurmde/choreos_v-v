== WHAT IS IT? ==
Rehearsal is an integrated framework supporting the automated testing 
of choreographies.
Currently, Rehearsal is spitted in two different projects: 
one including the features for correctness tests, supporting TDD;
and the other concerning with scalability tests.
== REQUIREMENTS ==
  1. java jdk 1.6
  2. maven 3.0.4
== COMPILING IT ==
Both the projects are available at:
svn://svn.forge.objectweb.org/svnroot/choreos/trunk/governance/tdd
in directories 'rehearsal' and 'scalability_explorer'.
They can be compiled with 'mvn compile'
== RUNNING IT ==
As Rehearsal is a framework, it is not properly run, but is supposed
to be used by other projects.
The simplest way to do this is by installing Rehearsal in your local
maven repository and including it as a dependence in your project.
The installation can be done with 'mvn install'
To establish the dependencies, you should add the following to your pom.xml.
for correctness tests:
    <dependency>
      <groupId>eu.choreos</groupId>
      <artifactId>rehearsal</artifactId>
      <version>0.13</version>
      <scope>jar</scope>
    </dependency>
for scalability tests:
    <dependency>
      <groupId>eu.choreos.vv</groupId>
      <artifactId>scalability_explorer</artifactId>
      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      <scope>jar</scope>
    </dependency>
== VERIFYING IF IT WORKS ==
Check if you can import and use Rehearsal's components in your project.
